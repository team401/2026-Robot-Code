# Elastic Layouts

Layouts store all tabs in one file, so one layout file must contain all tuning layouts that we want to have available when tuning.

To accomplish this, when adding a new elastic layout, open tuning.json in elastic. Add a new tab named "[Your subsystem] Tuning", add your tuning layout, and then save the file.
