## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

To get set up running simulation, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) to install the latest version of WPILib.

Next, clone the project and open it in 2026 WPILib VS Code.

### Starting Simulation

The first time you open the project, your editor might show you errors about undefined types ending in `AutoLogged`. This is because these classes are generated by AdvantageKit's annotation processor, and won't exist until you run a build. Try `./gradlew build` in the terminal or the `Build Robot Code` in your command palette, which can be opened with Ctrl+Shift+P, or Cmd+Shift+P on mac. These won't fix the issue until you restart or refresh VSCode, but you can do that in the next step.

After building, try running simulation with `Simulate Robot Code` in the command palette. Select `Sim GUI` when prompted, and press `OK`. You will likely see a prompt warning you that the build failed. Rather than pressing `Continue`, click `Fix..`. From the options, choose to clean the Java workspace cache and refresh. After this, try running `Simulate Robot Code` again. It should start up without issues. If you're still seeing errors, either in VSCode or from the simulate task failing, you can try restarting VSCode. In addition, clicking `Continue` on the warning that build failed is sometimes "good enough" to continue testing your code.
